3 — Critical UX & UI Patterns
Hero (first 2 screenfuls)
      * Left: concise headline + subheading + CTA (primary) + secondary CTA (view work / pricing).

      * Right: a small animated bento-grid or 3D/neumorphic card stack showing product screenshots (subtle parallax).

      * Short proof strip under hero: 3 client logos + one-line metric or client quote.

Bento-grid usage
         * Use a responsive bento grid for sections (features, case highlights, services). Vary card sizes for hierarchy while preserving a consistent baseline grid. Bento layouts are a current, effective design trend for agency websites. Mockuuups Studio

Portfolio / Case studies
            * Each case study single-page: Problem → Solution → Tech → Outcome (metrics), with live link / demo and short code-stack. Use animated transitions between cards. Reference Awwwards winners for inspirational layout choices. Awwwards

How We Work (process)
               * 4-step timeline: Discovery → Ship MVP → Iterate → Support. Each step as a bento-card with icon, short copy, and micro-animation.

Contact / Conversion
                  * Primary CTA: “Book a 15-min call” (Calendly modal)

                  * Secondary CTA: “Request Proposal” (form: name, company, budget range, timeline, stack, file upload)

                  * Use a sticky floating CTA on scroll for conversion.

4 — Components & Tech stack
Recommended stack (scaffold in Cursor):
                     * Framework: Next.js (app router) + TypeScript

                     * Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first) + component library tokens (use CSS variables for brand colors)

                     * Animations: Framer Motion for page transitions & micro-interactions; GSAP for advanced timeline/scroll-driven effects (only if needed)

                     * 3D / Visuals (optional): react-three-fiber for lightweight product mockups or Lottie animations for illustrations

                     * Image optimization: Next/Image or external image service (imgix/Cloudinary)

                     * CMS / Content: Sanity / Contentful / Strapi (headless) — pick Sanity if you want a developer-friendly studio + structured content (case studies)

                     * Forms & lead capture: React Hook Form + serverless function (Next.js API route) + integrate with Airtable / HubSpot / Notion or Zapier for lead management. Calendly embed for calls.

                     * Analytics: Google Analytics + GA4, Hotjar or FullStory for session heatmaps (optional). Use server-side analytics or Plausible if privacy-minded.

                     * SEO: Next.js meta tags, Open Graph, sitemap, robots, structured data (JSON-LD for Organization + Breadcrumbs)

                     * Auth (admin): 3rd-party admin via CMS. No public auth required.

                     * Hosting & CI: Vercel (recommended) — instant deploys with Next.js; GitHub Actions alternative.

________________


5 — Accessibility & Performance Requirements
                        * WCAG 2.1 AA compliance baseline: semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation, focus outlines. Smart color contrast checks. Smart Insights

                        * Images lazy-loaded, use responsive srcset.

                        * Avoid heavy hero autoplay video; prefer animated SVG or Lottie with reduced-motion support.

                        * Respect prefers-reduced-motion — reduce/disable animations accordingly.

                        * Lighthouse target: Performance ≥ 85, Accessibility ≥ 90, Best Practices ≥ 90, SEO ≥ 90.

________________


6 — Animations & Motion direction (specifics)
                           * Page transitions: smooth fade + upward motion for content blocks (Framer Motion variants).

                           * Hero illustration: parallax card stack with subtle depth (framer-motion + transform: translateZ) or Lottie.

                           * Scroll reveal: staggered card reveals with 3D tilt (Framer Motion + IntersectionObserver).

                           * Microinteractions: hover lift on portfolio cards, CTA ping on hover, animated progress bars on case metrics.

                           * Lead modal: animated modal slide from bottom with backdrop blur.

                           * Performance note: keep animations GPU-accelerated, use will-change sparingly, avoid layout thrash.

7 — Content strategy & copy (high-level)
                              * Tone: confident, friendly, technical.

                              * Hero headline examples:

                                 * “Build. Launch. Scale. With SriTek.”

                                 * “Your full-stack product engineering team — on demand.”

                                    * Use short case-study bullets with measurable outcomes (e.g., “Reduced onboarding dropoff by 28%”, “MVP launched in 21 days”).

                                    * CTA copy: “Book a 15-min call”, “Get a proposal”, “See our work”.

8 — SEO, Schema & Launch checklist
                                       * Meta titles & descriptions per page; prioritize keywords: “MVP development”, “React engineering agency”, “freelance dev agency India / remote”

                                       * JSON-LD: Organization, WebSite (search box), Breadcrumb, LocalBusiness (if you want India-specific signals)

                                       * XML sitemap & robots.txt

                                       * Canonical tags & Open Graph images (social cards)

12 — Deliverables & Timeline (suggested MVP)
You asked for a plan doc + Cursor prompt. If you want an execution timeline — here's a tight MVP schedule you can ask Cursor to scaffold:
                                                   * Day 0: Cursor scaffold Next.js TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion + basic pages

                                                   * Day 1–3: Build components (Hero, Bento grid, Card, Nav, Footer) + Contact form + Calendly integration

                                                   * Day 4–6: Portfolio templates + case study pages + blog skeleton (CMS hookup)

                                                   * Day 7: SEO, analytics, accessibility audit, Lighthouse fixes, deploy to Vercel.

(These are sprint-like tasks; adjust according to how much you’ll hand-build vs. use Cursor output.)
